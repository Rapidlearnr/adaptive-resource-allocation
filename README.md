# adaptive-resource-allocation
This project simulates an adaptive resource allocation system in a multiprogramming operating system environment, where multiple processes compete for limited CPU and memory resources.  The system dynamically monitors CPU usage, memory consumption, process priority, and arrival time, and allocates resources in real time.
